                    Welcome! If you're not familiar with computer programming, I highly encourage you to research it before continuing with this article. For everyone
                    else, I'll give you a brief overview of Python. We'll go over some of the beginning concepts found in every programming language, and there will 
                    be complementary Python examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So... <em>What is Python</em>? 
                </p>
                    <blockquote>
                            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, 
                            combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
                            or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces 
                            the cost of program maintenance. - Python Software Foundation

                <p>
                    Basically, it's an easy to use language. A lot of programmers prefer using because of its increased productivity and no compilation step. This makes
                    debugging Python much easier compared to other lower level languages. Plus, Python is a ton of fun! Let's check it out.

                    <header id="data"><h2>Data Types</h2></header>
            <p>
                So there are 4 basic data types in Python:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Integer</b> - includes whole numbers as well as their negative counter parts. However, they do include not numbers that count past the decimal point. <br>
                        <code># ex. 5</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Float</b> - includes all numbers that include digits past the decimial point, even if they are just zeros after the decimal point. <br>
                        <code># ex. 6.103</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>String</b> - any character(s) inside of a pair of single or double quotes. <br>
                        <code># ex. 'hello'</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Boolean</b> - a binary data type with the values of True or False.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                There are several more technical data types in Python, but we'll stick with the basics to avoid confusion.

            <section class="main-section">
                <header id="arithmetic"><h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2></header>
                <p>
                    The arithmetic operators function similarly as they would in other programming languages. However, there are some slight differences that we will point out.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>+ Addition</b> - Adds two operands together<br>
                            <code>2 + 2 --> 4</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>- Subtract </b>- Subtracts the right operand from the left<br>
                            <code>4 - 1 --> 3</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>* Multiplication</b> - Multiplies two operands together <br>
                            <code>4 * 3 --> 12</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>/ Division</b> - Divides right operand from left <br>
                            <code>6 / 3 --> 2.0</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>% Modulus</b> - Divides with the right operand from the left and outputs the remainder <br>
                            <code>5 % 2 --> 1</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>** Exponent</b> - Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand <br>
                            <code>5 ** 2 --> 25</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>// Floor Division</b> - Divides the right operand from the left and outputs the quotient as an integers <br>
                            <code>50 // 7 --> 7</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Note: Normal division in Python will always produce a float, even if both operands are integers. In contrast, older languages will always 
                        produce an integer when dividing two integers together, even if the result is supposed to logically produce a decimal value. For Example, 5 / 2 in
                        Python would produce 2.5, but in C++, the result is truncated from the decimal point onwards. Floor division does exactly this in the Python.
        
                        Also, the exponent operator is included in the Python environment, so there is no need to import from any libraries or modules.

            <section class="main-section">
                <header id="variables"><h2>Variables</h2></header>
                <p>
                    Initializing a variable is very easy in Python. You must have a variable with any name, an assignment operator, and its corresponding value. <br>
                </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            x = 30
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    However, there are two few naming rules that we have to be aware of:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You cannot start a variable name with a number. <br>

                            <code>3zebras   # Wrong!</code>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You cannot have any special characters other than an underscore in the name.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

    <pre>
        <code>
            bird.    # Wrong!
            bird_    # Okay  
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    Python also shows some differences in its variables from the older languages. In the older languages, you have to declare a variable, which allows
                    the compiler know what type of Data/Class it belongs to. You can initialize the vaariable when it is declared, or assign it a value later, but you cannot
                    assign a value outside of its class or data type. So an <em>int</em> variable cannot hold a <em>char</em>, and a <em>char</em> variable cannot hold a <em>bool</em> value, and so forth.
                    However, because all Python vairables are just references, they hold more flexibilty in their assignment and reassignment.  
                </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            x = 3
            x = 4.0 
            x = 'this is normal'
            x = True 
            
            #no errors. x holds the latest assigned variables
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    Note: Because of how Python variables dynamically allocate memory for which ever type of value that is stored, we must intialized the variable with some type
                    of value. 
                </p>

            <section class="main-section">
                <header id="conditionals"><h2>Conditionals</h2></header>
                <p>
                    Conditionals work the same as it does in most other languages. The syntax is a little different but much simpler.
                </p>
                <h3>The If... Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply, if the condition within the if statement holds true, then the statement(s) nested underneath will run. Otherwise,
                    it will not run.
                </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            if 2 + 2 == 4:
                print("Runs")  
                
            #Output:
            #Runs 
        </code>
    </pre>
                <h3>The Elif...Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Just like the <em>else if</em> in other languages, <em>elif</em> is a shortened name and functions the same way. Paired with
                    and <em>if</em> statement, the condition and corresponding statement(s) will only run if its paried <em>if</em> statement evalutes to false. You can
                    pair as many elif statements to a an if statement that you want, but only one of them will run regardless of how many elif statements are true. <br>
                </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            if 2 + 3 == 6:
                print('A')  # False
            elif 3 + 3 &gt; 9:
                print('B')  # False
            elif 9 &lt; 10:
                print('C')  # True
            elif 2 == 2:
                print('D')  # True, but not first

            #Output:
            #C
        </code>
    </pre>
                <h3>The Else...Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Much like the elif statement, the else statement must be paired with an if statement. The only difference is that
                    the else statement hold no conditional statement. So, the nested statement underneath else will automatically run if the <strong>if</strong> statement 
                    (and all other elif statments if they are present) evaluates to be false. 
                </p>
    
    <pre>
        <code>
            if 3 &gt; 9:
                print('A')
            elif 4 &lt; 0:
                print ('B')
            else:
                print('C') 
            
            #Output:
            #C
        </code>
    </pre>
            </section>
            
            <section class="main-section">
                <header id="loops"><h2>Loops</h2></header>
                <h3>While Loops</h3> 
                <p>
                    While loops are a way to run a statement or set of statements as long as the condition for the while loop is true.
                </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            x = 0
            while x &lt;=4:
                print('Hi')
                x = x + 1
            
            #Output:
            #Hi
            #Hi
            #Hi
            #Hi
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    Note: In our example, the variable is inititalized outside of the while loop and is used as a limit for the while condition. The value changed
                    within the body of the while loop so that the condition will change over time. Without it, the body of the while loop would run infintely.
                </p>
                <h3>For Loop</h3> 
                <p>
                    For loops in Python has been simplified greatly compared to older languages. In a for loop iteration, you only have to specify
                    two things, the range of items to be iterated, and the item itself. For example let's take a look at two different ways to iterate the same list.
                    We'll being with a specific number range to iterate the index of an list.
                </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            exampleList = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
            for i in range(0,4):
                print(exampleList[i])
            
            #Output:
            #A
            #B
            #C
            #D
        </code>
    </pre>
                <p>
                    As we can see, the i is a local variable that holds the value of each iterated number in the number range. We begin the iteration at 0 and end the number
                    before 4. So the body will loop starting from 0 until it reaches 3 which still is 4 iterations. That avoids any index errors since lists indices 
                    start from 0. Let's look another way.
                </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            for item in exampleList:
                print(item)

            #Output:
            #A
            #B
            #C
            #D
        </code>
    </pre>      
                <p>
                    This type of iteration is much simpler. It iterates every item in the container, which is exampleList, in the same order that it was originally set. 
                </p>

                <header id="functions"><h2>Functions</h2></header>
                <p>
                    Functions in Python come in several different variations. The most common ones you probably have seen already include the built-in <i>print()</i>. Others
                    are attached to items like <i>"help".upper()</i>. The function is follows the element with a preceding period. This is called a method, because the
                    function belongs and works within a specified class. However, we'll leave that for the more advanced Python tutorials. Let's talk about user defined
                    functions where you will most likely start with functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin defining a user defined method, let's discuss the required elements:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>def - allows the Python interpreter know that this will be function. </li>
                        <li>functionName - name of the function that will be used to call the function.</li>
                        <li>argument (optional) - decided by the user, argument(s) are to be processed within the function.</li>
                        <li>return (optional) - outputs some result and ends the function execution.</li>
                    </ul>

    <pre>
        <code>
            def functionName(argument):
                #executing statements
                return someResult
        </code>
    </pre>

            The above example shows the basic syntax of a user defined Python function. However, the optional elements of a Python function aren't always necessary.
            Here, we have an example of a function with neither an argument nor a return.        
        </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            def scream():
                print('HELLO')
            
            scream()
            
            #Output: 
            #HELLO
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
            Easy and simple right? How about if we wanted to have an argument with no return value?
        </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            def sayWord(word):
                print(word)
            
            sayWord('hello')

            #Output: 
            #hello
        </code>
    </pre>

        <p>
            If you have arguments for you function, be sure to include them in the call. Otherwise, you may get an exception since it is missing a necessary component for the
            function to run. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally if we wanted to add a return statement to get a value from the function call, we'll simply have the function return some type of value.
        </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            def sumOfTwo(a,b):
                return a + b

            result = sumOfTwo(3,1)
            print(result)

            #Output: 
            #4
        </code>
    </pre>
        <p>
            Notice: Even though we get some type of value back from sumOfTwo, we still have to store the value in a variable, otherwise it will disappear!
